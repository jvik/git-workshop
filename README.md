# Introduction to Version Control with Git

Git is an essential tool in a developer's toolbox, widely regarded as the most popular version control system. Understanding how to use Git effectively is crucial for tracking changes in files, improving productivity, and collaborating efficiently with others.

This is a compact 1-hour workshop covering the fundamentals of Git. You will learn how to set up Git, create repositories, make commits, and work with Pull Requests on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

### Git

Ensure that Git is installed on your machine and accessible from the command line/terminal.  
If you already have Git installed, you can skip this step. On Windows, check if you have `git bash` installed. If you are on macOS or Linux, you can check if Git is available by typing `git version`.

If Git is not installed, you can find instructions for installing it on all operating systems here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

### Editor

You are free to use the code editor of your choice, but we highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## How to get started

- Even though you have this file (`README.md`) on your local machine if you have cloned the repository, it is easier to read on GitHub due to formatting. We therefore recommend using a browser to read the exercises.
- Start with Exercise 1, and feel free to ask if anything is unclear or if there is something you would like to discuss.

:exclamation: We will not use the GUI client in this workshop. Instead, we will use the terminal/command line (CLI). It is a good idea to avoid copy-pasting commands to get used to typing Git commands, even though it may feel inconvenient at first. Once you get the hang of it, using the CLI tool becomes an efficient way to work.

## Exercises

This workshop contains 3 exercises that cover the essential Git workflow:

- [Exercise 1 - Setup and First Commit](exercise-1/README.md) - Configure Git, create a repository, and make your first commit
- [Exercise 2 - Branches and Merging](exercise-2/README.md) - Work with branches and merge changes
- [Exercise 3 - Pull Requests on GitHub](exercise-3/README.md) - Create and merge Pull Requests

### Symbols and notation used in the exercises
